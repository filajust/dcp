# DCP
Dotfiles. Sensible defaults. Lots of them. Very opinionated.

## Installation
If you already have dotfiles, you'll need to get them out of the way for this to work as intended. You can reach a script for deleting them (make backups first!) here:
```
curl https://raw.github.com/dpoggi/dcp/master/bin/dcp-remove-dotfiles | bash
```

Once you've got that handled, the installation script can be found as follows:
```
curl https://raw.github.com/dpoggi/dcp/master/bin/dcp-bootstrap | bash
```

## Usage
I'll write this soon, I promise.
